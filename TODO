I welcome feedback and patches. Fork at will!!

Here's a list of issues I have with the current implementation:

DRY violations - Code duplication between _setManagerAttributes and
_setConnectionAttributes as well as _getCache.

Doctrine model loading - Models without namespaces require special autoloading or the
use of the fallback autoloader even with the models and generated models paths
on the include path.

Adding model paths to the include path - Determine whether this should be
handled in the Doctrinepaths resource plugin or in the bootstrap (i.e.
index.php)

Unit testing - Determine how to perform more thorough tests.
