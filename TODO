I welcome feedback and patches. Fork at will!!

Here's a list of issues I have with the current implementation:

Model autoloading - more on this later. For now, just know that the only
supported use case is that of non-namespaced/non-modular models generated from
yaml. You will need to:

- Add your models_path and generated_models_path to the
include_path in your entry-point script (e.g. public/index.php)

- Add a custom _initAutoload method to your bootstrap(s) consisting of the
  following:

protected function _initAutoload()
{
    $autoloader = Zend_Loader_Autoloader::getInstance();
    if (!$autoloader->isFallbackAutoloader()) {
        $autoloader->setFallbackAutoloader(true);
    }
    return $autoloader;
}

Unit testing - Determine how to perform more thorough tests.
