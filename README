Parables is a sandbox for my personal experimental work with the Zend
Framework as well as proposals submitted to the ZF project.

See http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Home

The auth adapter and paginator adapter are not my work, but are included here
for convenience and so as not to recreate the wheel. Thanks to the authors of
those components. I hope to see a Doctrine extras library at some point but
understand if is not a likely priority for the ZF team. In the meantime..
