Parables is a collection of Zend Framework components and resources.

See parables-demo at http://github.com/mlurz71/parables-demo/tree for a basic
reference application.

Fri Oct 30 11:23:57 CDT 2009 As some may notice, I removed a bunch of resource
plugins. There were several reasons for this, but primarily:

- A Dojo resource plugin has since been added to the framework making mine
  obsolete (the one in the ZF is better anyhow)

- A Log resource plugin proposal has been submitted, and the added effort just
  isn't justified. I think eventually a Log resource plugin will make it into
the ZF. For now use an _init method and see
http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16023777

- In several cases I decided that the level of abstraction just wasn't
  justified and so instead should be provided in a layout/view script, as an
_init method, etc.

Hopefully paring down the scope of the library will give me more time to work
on the remaining components.

I welcome feedback and patches. Fork at will!!
