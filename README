Parables is a sandbox for experimental Zend Framework components. The majority
of these components are integration points between the ZF and Doctrine OR/M.
However, additional components not related to Doctrine/ZF integration are also
included.

For the sake of convenience, components are included which are not my work.
These components and their authors are noted below.

The auth adapter was developed by Jason Eisenmenger & David A. Werner. See
http://framework.zend.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3866950 for
additional information.

The paginator adapter was developed by Jason Eisenmenger. See
http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Paginator_Adapter_Doctrine+-+Jason+Eisenmenger
for additional information.
