Mon Aug 24 12:11:14 CDT 2009 MJL - Implemented experimental module-based model
support for the Doctrine resource plugin.

Please update your application.ini files such that paths are namespaced as in:

resources.doctrine.paths.<namespace>.data_fixtures_path = APPLICATION_PATH "/../doctrine/data/fixtures"
resources.doctrine.paths.<namespace>.migrations_path = APPLICATION_PATH "/../doctrine/migrations"
resources.doctrine.paths.<namespace>.models_path = APPLICATION_PATH "/models"
resources.doctrine.paths.<namespace>.models_generated_path = APPLICATION_PATH "/models/generated"
resources.doctrine.paths.<namespace>.sql_path = APPLICATION_PATH "/../doctrine/data/sql"
resources.doctrine.paths.<namespace>.yaml_schema_path = APPLICATION_PATH "/../doctrine/schema"

Where <namespace> is an arbitrary name used to identify the set of paths.
Using the name of the connection associated with that set of models might not
be a bad idea for consistencies sake.

While I would appreciate a more terse configuration throughout, I prefer a
little verbosity when clarity is at issue. Unfortunately, cases such as this
necessitate increased verbosity since there is no getting around the need for
<namespace> in order to support modular models.
